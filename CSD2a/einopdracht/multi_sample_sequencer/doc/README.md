# Multisample Rhythmical Sequences with MIDI and Multiprocessing

This code prompts the user to create multiple rhythmical sequences to be played back simultaneously through multiprocessing. The created sequences can be saved as individual one-track MIDI files.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required libraries installed, including `simpleaudio` for audio playback and `midi_writer` for MIDI file creation.

## How to Use

Follow the prompts in the terminal to create rhythmical sequences. You can specify the number of sequences, note durations, instrument choices, loop times, and BPM for each sequence. The code will then play back the sequences using multiprocessing.

## Usage

Run the code and follow the instructions provided in the terminal to create and play back sequences. You can choose to save the sequences as MIDI files as well.
